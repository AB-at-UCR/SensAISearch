# SenseiSearch

## Project Overview

SenseiSearch aims to develop a robust multimodal search engine leveraging OpenAI’s CLIP model for both text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval. The system will integrate refined embeddings, semantic filtering, and user feedback to continually improve search relevance and deliver high accuracy on benchmark datasets.

## Key Features

- **Multimodal Retrieval:** Supports both text-to-image and image-to-text search using CLIP.
- **Refined Embeddings:** Utilizes advanced embedding techniques and semantic filtering for improved relevance.
- **User Feedback Loop:** Incorporates user feedback to iteratively enhance search results.
- **Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning:** Employs LoRA adapters for fine-tuning on domain-specific data, boosting retrieval accuracy.
- **Data Augmentation & Segmentation:** Applies data augmentation and image foreground segmentation to enrich training data and focus on salient content.
- **Prompt Optimization:** Optimizes prompts for more context-aware and semantically aligned retrieval.
- **OOD Detection:** Implements out-of-distribution detection to quantify and visualize confidence in both queries and results, increasing system reliability.

## Technical Approach

- **CLIP Model Integration:** Core retrieval powered by OpenAI’s CLIP for cross-modal understanding.
- **Fine-Tuning with LoRA:** Lightweight adapters enable efficient domain adaptation.
- **Semantic Filtering:** Filters results based on semantic similarity and context.
- **Confidence Visualization:** OOD detection provides transparency into model certainty for each search.

## Expected Outcomes

- High retrieval accuracy on standard and custom benchmarks.
- Improved user satisfaction through relevance feedback and adaptive learning.
- Reliable, explainable search results with confidence metrics.
